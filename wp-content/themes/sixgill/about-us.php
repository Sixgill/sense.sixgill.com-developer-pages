								<br>His programs accelerated demand and market comprehension for early pioneers Lotus Development Corp., Nantucket Corp., Gupta Corp. inquiry.com and Callidus Software. He advised dozens of enterprise, communications, mobile and media start-ups during his work in venture capital at Clearstone Venture Partners, and returned to the operating world in 2008 as CEO at photorealistic animation innovator Big Stage Entertainment. He helped companies find focus and exits in collaborative accountability and analytic database markets, and led a product innovation and business revival as CEO at manufacturer Seymour Duncan during the Crash. After launching streaming data innovator Bottlenose into revenue and raising its Series B financing, Phil’s renewed interest in new data types with strategic value led him to reformulate Zos Communications as Sixgill LLC for the enterprise.</p>
